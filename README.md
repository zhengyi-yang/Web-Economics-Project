# COMPGW02/M041: the Web Economics Project

## SUMMARY

In this assignment, you are required to work on an online
advertising problem. You will help advertisers to form a
bidding strategy in order to place their ads online in a realtime
bidding system. You are required to train a bidding
strategy based on an impression training set. The aim of
this project is to help you understand some basic concepts
and write a computer program in real-time bidding based
display advertising. As you will be evaluated both as a group
as well as individually, part of the assignment is to train a
model of your choice independently. The performance of the
model trained by your team, which is either a combination
of the individually developed models or the best performing
individually developed model, will be (mainly) evaluated
on the Click-through Rate achieved on a provided test set.
In order for you to properly evaluate the performance of
each of your models before that, a benchmark click-through
rate on the validation set will be provided. Before the final
submission, you are also given the opportunity to hand in
the preliminary result of your teamâ€™s model on the test set,
which allows you to compare the performance to that of your
peers.
